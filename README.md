markdown templates for better communication

## motivation for markdown templates

Markdown is communication and in an effort to better communicate to others I am organizing some template for myslef and the world.

I was particularly inspired by the table for the [Constantinople progress tracker](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/53) that @souptacular made and all the infomation and clarity that it communicated in one tables.
